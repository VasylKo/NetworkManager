## NetworkManager - a NSOperation-based implementation of delegate-based NSURLSession

--

This is an demonstration of a `NSOperation`-based implementation of delegate-based `NSURLSession`.

Because the delegate-based `NSURLSession` object uses a single object as the delegate for both session and task delegate methods.

This is for illustrative purposes only. 

Developed in Xcode 5.1.1 for iOS 7.0+, also tested on Xcode 6.0 Beta.
